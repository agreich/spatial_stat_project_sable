FIRST: run the stats_proj_sablefish scriptfile.

For some reason, it's not working well with Rnotebook.

So, run that scriptfile first, and now I'll try working in R notebook.


Treat the data as geostatisitcal data
conduct a Spatial Logistic Regression
and use the spBayes package

My datafile name is: Sable_geo

So, logistic regression means we either use 0 or 1 for the data. I think I'll need to manipulate the Sable_geo data to reflect this.

```{r}
names(Sable_geo)
Sable_geo$data
length(Sable_geo$data)

#I can do this with a for loop.. or with mutate
Sable_geo_df_2 <- as.data.frame(Sable_geo)
Sable_geo_df_binary <- Sable_geo_df_2 %>% mutate(data = ifelse(data>0, 1, 0))
length(Sable_geo_df_binary$data)

Sable_geo_binary <- as.geodata(Sable_geo_df_binary)
##warning that there's some overlapping locations. I shold think about getting rid of duplicates?
```
