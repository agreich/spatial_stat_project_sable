# spatial_stat_project_sable

Spatial_stats_proj_sable the code to run first
(I kept them separate because I thought there was a glitch in Rnb with tidyverse, but it turns out that it was just a bug in the code (which I fixed))

R_nb_sable_2 is my current analysis attemps. It's messy, but I'm trying to figure out how to get the spBayes funciton to run
-> and then I'll figure out how to get it to run better (with better starting values, priors, and MCMC movements)
